👋 Hi there! My name is Surgeon!
I'm passionate about cybersecurity and web development, and I enjoy exploring how these two fields intersect to create secure and efficient applications. I focus on:

🔒 Cybersecurity: Vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, and developing tools to enhance the security of systems and networks.
🌐 Web Development: Building dynamic and responsive applications using modern technologies like JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
I'm always eager to learn new skills and stay updated with the latest trends. 🚀

If you have any interesting ideas or projects in mind, feel free to reach out!
